## Stakeholders

### Primary User Interview

**Name**: Nina Johnson  
**User Type**: Current NYU Student; Regular Campus Study Space User

#### Goals / Needs
- Quickly identify available study spaces in real time
- Find study environments that match certain needs (e.g. quiet vs. group-friendly)
- See specific seating availability within a space (e.g. tables near window)
- Recieve personalized study space reccomendations based on set preferences and current crowdedness conditions across study areas 
- See information about what a building or space may provide (e.g. computer or printer access, nearby cafe or dining hall)

#### Problems / Frustrations
- Study spaces prioritize aesthetics over functionality, resulting in limited seating in NYU buildings during prime hours
- For existing NYU study space reservations, the process is long and inconvenient
- Lack of visibility into which specific areas or tables are occupied, leading to wasted time searching for a suitable study space
- It's sometimes unclear what spaces are meant for silent study without checking in person, making it harder to find locations for group study
- Existing tools (e.g. Google "busy hours") don't reflect real time conditions or student needs



## Product Vision Statement

This app is an intuitive, real-time campus crowdedness app that helps NYU students quickly find available study spaces that match their preferences for noise level, resources, seating, and group size wihout wasting time searching in-person.
